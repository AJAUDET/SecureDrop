# SecureDrop
SecureDrop is a collaborative effort to create our own version of Apple's AirDrop

Project: Secure File Transfer

Objective
The aim of this project is to familiarize you with cryptographic tools by implementing a secure file transfer
protocol, similar to the widely-used AirDrop feature in Apple devices. Throughout this project, you
will gain practical experience in various cryptographic and cybersecurity concepts, including symmetric
and asymmetric cryptography, digital certificates, public key infrastructure, mutual authentication, nonrepudiation, confidentiality, integrity protection, and password security.
Project Team & Milestones
This project is designed to challenge and enhance your critical reasoning skills. To streamline the implementation process, we have three key recommendations:

Overview
Secure file transfer has various real-world applications, such as uploading source code, transmitting configuration files, or sharing sensitive banking information. In this project, we will focus on a specific scenario:
securely transferring a file to another person’s computer within our contact list and on the same local network
(wired or wireless).
This project will take shape as a command-line utility, referred to as SecureDrop, featuring an executable
named secure_drop. Our primary emphasis will be on the Linux environment. As the semester progresses,
the instructor will furnish Docker containers and networks to facilitate code deployment. Below, we provide a
sample project run, accompanied by explanatory comments:
# The secure_drop command serves as the entry point for the application. If no user exists,
# the registration module will activate, with the email address serving as user identifier.
$ secure_drop
No users are registered with this client.
Do you want to register a new user (y/n)? y
Enter Full Name: John Doe
Enter Email Address: john.doe@gmail.com
Enter Password: *********
Re-enter Password: *********
Passwords Match.
User Registered.
Exiting SecureDrop.
$
# The user registration is a one-time process. Once a user is registered on a client, the
# login module is subsequently activated. After a successful login, a "secure_drop>" shell
# is initiated.
$ secure_drop
Enter Email Address: john.doe@gmail.com
Enter Password: ****
Email and Password Combination Invalid.
Enter Email Address: john.doe@gmail.com
Enter Password: *********
Welcome to SecureDrop.
Type "help" For Commands.
secure_drop> help
"add" -> Add a new contact
"list" -> List all online contacts
"send" -> Transfer file to contact
"exit" -> Exit SecureDrop
secure_drop>
# The "add" command adds a new contact for the user. If a contact already exists, it
# overwrites the existing details. Note that the email address is used as user identifier.
secure_drop> add
Enter Full Name: Alice
Enter Email Address: alice@gmail.com
Contact Added.
secure_drop> add
Enter Full Name: Bob
Enter Email Address: bob@gmail.com
Contact Added.
secure_drop>
# The "list" command displays only those contacts that meet specific criteria:
# 1. The contact email is in this user's contacts.
# 2. The contact has also added this user's email to their contacts.
# 3. The contact is online on the same network.
secure_drop> list
The following contacts are online:
* Bob <bob@gmail.com>
secure_drop>
# The "send" command transfers a file to the contact. The contact must receive an
# alert and approve the transfer. You can save the file to a directory of your choice,
# using the same file name as the transmitted file.
# Contact 'John Doe <john.doe@gmail.com>' is sending a file. Accept (y/n)?
secure_drop> send bob@gmail.com /home/john/Documents/bob.zip
Contact has accepted the transfer request.
File has been successfully transferred.
secure_drop> exit

Milestone 1 - User Registration
While implementing this module, consider the following:
1. Database implementation is not required; simple files, YAML, or JSON structures suffice.
2. Initially, implement the module without security controls. After verifying its correctness, introduce
security measures to protect against traditional password cracking attacks.
3. Emphasize code reusability. The password protections can be reused in the User Login milestone.
4. Utilize third-party APIs; the Python crypt module is valuable for implementing salted hashes for
password security.
5. Generate and store information during registration for mutual authentication in future milestones.
Assuming a CA (Certificate Authority) is present and trusted on all clients can facilitate the use of
digital certificates.

Milestone 2 - User Login
This milestone can be implemented swiftly. Key considerations include:
1. Leverage code reuse, as much of the code will resemble the User Registration milestone.
2. Examine how data from login credentials can bolster security in upcoming milestones. Keep this
information in memory while ensuring that password security remains intact. It’s essential to forget all
data from memory when the program exits to maintain security.

Milestone 3 - Adding Contacts
This module is relatively simple and can be implemented quickly. Key points to consider include:
1. Database implementation is unnecessary; simple files, YAML, or JSON structures suffice. Assume that
each user will have a limited number of contacts.
2. Explore ways to use information generated in Milestone 2 to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of
contact information. Prevent unauthorized access or tampering by malicious actors.

Milestone 4 - Listing Contacts
This milestone presents a complex challenge, demanding meticulous design and implementation. It marks
the initial phase where the application communicates over a network, expanding its attack surface. When
working on this module, consider the following key points:
1. Display contact information only if certain conditions are met: the user has added the contact, the
contact has reciprocated, and the contact is online on the same network.
2. Initially, implement the module without security controls, and later add security measures. Utilize TCP
or UDP for communication, and consider using Python’s socket module for transport layer protocols.
3. Strive to create reusable code, especially for cryptographic functions. Leveraging Python’s pycryptodome
and cryptography modules can greatly assist in the implementation of diverse cryptographic tasks.
These implementations can be valuable for later use in the Secure File Transfer milestone.
4. Encrypt identities of communicating entities to safeguard against packet sniffing. Compromise of contact
information can lead to spam and targeted attacks.
5. Mitigate impersonation attacks; implement a protocol for mutual authentication between entities.
6. Consider exchanging unique and protected information between entities to enhance security without
requiring reauthentication in subsequent steps. Ensure this information remains confidential.

Milestone 5 - Secure File Transfer
The complexity of this milestone depends on previous milestones. Key considerations include:
1. Efficiently transmit large files while maintaining file confidentiality and integrity. The received file must
match the transmitted one before notifying the user of a successful transfer.
2. Mitigate replay attacks by using sequence numbers, starting with a random seed on each client.
